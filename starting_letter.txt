Dear [name],

Hey, how have you been doing? It's been a while since we had a cup of coffee together. Life is full of
unpredictable outcomes pretty much like a TRNGs. We can never predict where we will be in the recent years.
Leave that discussion to that, you guys threw such an amazing surprise for me at my birthday, so I want to
give you all a treat for such a beautiful surprise. Make sure to be at my house at sharp 5 pm or if possible even
before on Friday night.

Hope you can make it!

Sudin
